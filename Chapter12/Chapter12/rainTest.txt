Got on board a westbound seven forty-Seven
Didn'T think before deciding what to do
Ooh, That talk of opportunities
Tv breaksand movies
Rang true, Sure rang true
Seems it never rains in southern california
Seems i'Ve often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in california
But girl, Don'T they warn ya?
It pours, Man, It pours
Out of work, I'M out of my head
I'M out of self respect, I'M out of bread
I'M under-Loved, I'M underfed
I wanna go home
It never rains in california
But girl, Don'T they warn ya?
It pours, Man, It pours
Will you tell the folks back home i nearly made it?
Had offers but didn'T know which one to take
Please don'T tell 'Em how you found me
Don'T tell 'Em how you found me
Gimme a break, Give me a break
